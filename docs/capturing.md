# Headless capture & visual QA

The renderer can draw a scene with **no window** — a surface-less wgpu context
draws into an offscreen texture and hands back raw RGBA pixels. Two things are
built on that (Plan 0013):

- a **`shot` CLI** (`standalone/examples/shot.rs`) that writes PNGs an agent can
  read and a metrics report it can parse, and
- a **differential visual-QA harness** in `core/tests/` that hard-tests every
  preset for reactivity, animation, shape sanity, and beat response, with an
  advisory distinctness report and golden-image regression.

A headless render is a **pure function** of `(preset, input, frame-count, size)` —
scenes are reseeded per capture, every frame steps at the fixed
`scenes::FALLBACK_DT` (the live app injects its real `dt` instead; Plan 0014),
and the DSP is deterministic — so renders are reproducible and diff-able.

> `--size` is part of that tuple, and since Plan 0033 it does more than crop: the
> `trails` and `kaleido_*` stages size their internal grid from the render target
> (ADR-0034), so a preset composing either one genuinely renders *differently* at
> 640x360 than at 1080p rather than merely smaller. A given size is still exactly
> reproducible; two sizes are no longer scaled versions of one picture. Capture at
> the size you are judging.

Everything here is **dev/agent tooling**. The `image` crate is a *dev-dependency*
only (ADR-0011), so the shipped `lmv.exe` is untouched; the CLI is a
`cargo run --example`, not a subcommand of the app.

> Package name note: the standalone crate is `standalone`, so the invocation is
> `cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- …`.

## The `shot` CLI

Render one preset to a PNG (the agent then Reads the file):

```bash
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset "Aurora" --frames 120 --out shot.png
```

Flags:

| flag | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--preset <name>` | preset to render (by name, as shown in the report / library); optional when the library holds exactly one preset |
| `--presets <dir>` | load the library from `<dir>` instead of the resolved preset directory |
| `--preset-file <path>` | load exactly one preset from `<path>` (beats `--presets`) |
| `--set k=v,...` | constant stimulus frame: `bass,mid,treb,onset,bar,novelty` (0..1), `tempo` (BPM), `beat` (non-zero = true). Keys are the **grammar's** names, so `tempo` is what a binding writes. It reaches the frame's scalars only — **not** the 64-band spectrum, so `bin(x)` reads `0` — see [the calibration traps](#the-three-calibration-traps) before trusting a value |
| `--frames <N>` | frames to advance before capture (default 120) |
| `--size <WxH>` | render size (default 1280x720) |
| `--out <path>` | output PNG (single shot) or dir/file (`--all`) |
| `--all` | contact sheet of every preset, labeled (needs `--out`) |
| `--report [family=<sys>]` | per-family metrics table — reactivity, animation, coverage and the [transient probe](#the-transient-columns); `family=` takes any `system` name (`fragment_field`, `swarm`, `parametric_curve`, `lsystem`, `star_pattern`, `reaction_diffusion`, `attractor`, `spectrum`) |
| `--json` | emit the report as JSON instead of a text table |
| `--signal <kind:param>` | synth-audio filmstrip (see below) |
| `--audio <clip.wav>` | filmstrip from a 16-bit PCM WAV |
| `--strip <N>` | frames tiled along the audio (default 8) |

Bad arguments and unknown presets exit non-zero with a message.

### The three calibration traps

`--set` is a **held** stimulus: it writes the analysis frame directly and that
same frame drives every captured frame. That makes it perfect for isolating one
binding and wrong for three things people reach for it anyway.

**Trap 1 — `--set beat=1` holds the beat gate high for the whole capture.** Real
beats are transient: `beat` fires on one hop and is false on the next. Held high,
every `beat`-driven accent in the preset is at full deflection in the still you
are looking at — a `+ beat * 0.155` thickness term that should flash for a frame
instead reads as the preset's baseline. The result is that a *working* preset
looks broken in a still (permanently blown-out, or so busy the geometry is
unreadable), and the natural response — turning the accent down — breaks it for
real on live audio. If you want a beat, capture one:

```bash
# Transient beats through the real onset detector, no asset needed
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset "Pulse Field" \
  --signal click:120 --strip 8 --out click.png
```

**Trap 2 — `--set` band magnitudes are not real levels.** `--set bass=0.8` writes
`0.8` onto the frame, but a band that arrives through the analyzer is normalized,
and it does not get anywhere near there. Measured through this very harness: a
**full-scale 60 Hz sine** (`--signal bass:60`) reads `bass ≈ 0.19`, and a **120
BPM click track** peaks at `bass ≈ 0.011`. A gain tuned to look right at
`bass=0.8` is roughly four times too weak on the loudest pure tone the harness
can synthesize, and the preset barely moves on real music.

So every `--signal` / `--audio` filmstrip now **prints the levels it measured**,
and those are the numbers to calibrate a gain against:

```
audio levels over 367 analysis hops (past warm-up) — calibrate gains against these, not against --set magnitudes:
  band       min     mean      max
  bass     0.187    0.187    0.187
  mid      0.000    0.000    0.000
  treb     0.000    0.000    0.000
```

`--audio <clip.wav>` on real material is the one that answers "what does my music
actually produce"; `--signal` answers it for a known synthetic tone. Use `--set`
to ask "does this binding do anything at all", not to decide how much of it to
apply.

**Trap 3 — `--set` leaves the 64-band spectrum silent, so `bin(x)` reads `0`.**
`--set` writes the analysis frame's *scalars*; there is no key for the log-band
array, and `AnalysisFrame::default()` leaves all 64 bands at zero. So under any
`--set` capture:

- every `bin(x)` call in an expression returns `0`, whatever `bass`/`mid`/`treb`
  say, and
- the whole **`spectrum`** system draws its `base` resting comb and nothing else —
  the readout is inert, which looks exactly like a broken preset.

This is not a bug in `--set` (it writes what you ask and nothing else); it is the
one part of the frame it cannot reach. **`bin(x)` and the `spectrum` system have
to be verified through `--signal` or `--audio`**, both of which run the real
analyzer over real samples and therefore populate the array:

```bash
# The band array through the real FFT - the readout actually moves
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset "Spectrum Comb" \
  --signal chord --strip 3 --out comb.png
```

`--report` builds its stimulus frames in code rather than from `--set`, and those
**do** light the band array (each named band lights the slice of the log spectrum
it summarises), so the report's numbers are real for a spectrum preset.

### What the report's columns mean

```
  preset            bass     mid    treb   onset    anim   cover  rise  fall
  Smooth Pulse     0.167   0.087   0.250   0.206   0.076   0.927    26    31
```

| column | question it answers |
|---|---|
| `bass` `mid` `treb` `onset` | how far the frame moves when that stimulus alone comes up, against silence — "does this preset respond to bass at all" |
| `anim` | how far the frame moves between two capture depths **under silence** — does it have a life of its own |
| `cover` | fraction of the frame that is lit, against the corner background |
| `rise` `fall` | the **transient probe** (below) — frames to settle after a step up, and after the matching step down |

Every one of those but the last two is a **settled** measurement: the capture
holds one stimulus for every frame it renders, so each smoother has converged
long before the pixels are read. That is the right question for "does it
respond", and it is exactly why those columns are **identical for any
`[smoothing]` constant**.

#### The transient columns

`rise` and `fall` are the one pair that is *not* settled. The probe drives a
step — silence, a held stimulus, silence again — reads back **every** frame, and
counts how many it takes for the frame to reach 90 % of its total change each
way ([ADR-0039](adrs/0039-verify-easing-with-a-transient-probe-not-a-committed-clip.md)).
That makes [ADR-0035](adrs/0035-asymmetric-attack-release-easing.md)'s
`{ attack, release }` pair visible: a scalar `[smoothing]` entry selects the same
constant both ways, so its two numbers match; a pair snaps up and glides down, so
`fall` runs well past `rise`.

Reading them:

- **`1` and `1`** — no easing on whatever the stimulus drives. The frame is fully
  there the frame after the step.
- **equal, both large** — a scalar `[smoothing]` entry, or an asymmetric one whose
  two constants are close.
- **`fall` much larger than `rise`** — an `{ attack, release }` pair doing its job.
- **`0` and `0`** — the step did not move the frame at all. Check the reactivity
  columns: this usually means the preset does not respond to the stimulus, not
  that its easing is instant.

Two limits worth knowing before you act on a number. The probe's window is
**48 frames (0.8 s) each way**, so a release constant longer than about 0.35 s
does not fully settle inside it and reads *clamped* rather than measured — the
asymmetry still shows, the magnitude understates. And more fundamentally, the
probe measures the **frame**, not the parameter; a preset whose visual response
saturates reads flat no matter what its easing says.

### Which preset library a shot uses

Highest precedence first:

1. `--preset-file <path>` — one preset, parsed from that file.
2. `--presets <dir>` — every `*.toml` in that directory.
3. **`LMV_PRESET_DIR`** — the environment override
   ([ADR-0014](adrs/0014-preset-dir-override-for-dev-iteration.md)).
4. The per-user preset directory (`%APPDATA%\light-music-visualizer\presets` on
   Windows; see [`presets.md`](presets.md#where-preset-files-live)).
5. The presets compiled into the binary.

The `[source]` label printed after every capture names the winner, so a PNG's
provenance is never a guess. The two flags are **errors** when they come up empty
— a missing file, unparseable TOML, or a directory with no valid presets exits
non-zero rather than quietly capturing some other library. Levels 3–5 degrade
downward instead, exactly as the app does.

`shot` resolves levels 3 and 4 through the **same** `standalone` library function
the app calls, so the two can never disagree about which folder your edit landed
in.

### Editing presets live

Point both surfaces at the repo's version-controlled `presets/` and edit a
`.toml` — no rebuild, no relaunch:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell): the app reloads the edited file within ~150 ms
$env:LMV_PRESET_DIR = "./presets"; cargo run -p standalone --release

# ...and every shot in that shell reads the same folder
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset "Aurora" --out shot.png
```

For a one-off capture, the flags say it explicitly and need no environment:

```bash
# The whole repo library
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --presets presets --preset "Aurora" --out a.png

# A single file — --preset is unnecessary, the one-entry library names itself
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset-file presets/fragment_aurora.toml --out a.png

# Metrics for the repo library rather than the seeded per-user copy
LMV_PRESET_DIR=./presets cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --report
```

The app hot-reloads an override folder but **never seeds** into it (it is yours,
not ours), and `diagnostics.log` / `config.toml` stay under the per-user app
directory. The foobar2000 plugin does not read `LMV_PRESET_DIR`.

### Examples

```bash
# Shot a preset under a loud beat, at a custom size
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset "Pulse Field" \
  --set bass=1,onset=1,beat=1 --size 960x540 --out pulse.png

# Both sides of a tempo gate, e.g. `select(tempo > 130, ..., ...)`
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset-file presets/rose_zoom.toml \
  --set tempo=90 --out slow.png
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset-file presets/rose_zoom.toml \
  --set tempo=160 --out fast.png

# Labeled contact sheet of the whole library
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --all --out gallery/

# Metrics report as a text table, or JSON for parsing
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --report
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --report --json > report.json

# Beat filmstrip from a synthesized click track (no asset needed)
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset "Pulse Field" \
  --signal click:120 --strip 8 --out click.png

# Filmstrip from a real clip (16-bit PCM WAV)
cargo run -p standalone --example shot -- --preset "Burst" \
  --audio assets/test/clip.wav --strip 8 --out clip.png
```

`--signal` kinds: `click:<bpm>`, `bass:<hz>`, `treble:<hz>`, `noise:<seed>`,
`chord`. The synth path needs no committed asset. `--audio` reads uncompressed
16-bit PCM WAV only (a hand-rolled reader — no decoder dependency); other
encodings are a followup.

> **Test audio is added manually and never committed.** Drop a 16-bit PCM WAV
> into [`assets/test/`](../assets/test/) — that folder is gitignored (only its
> README is tracked), so no licensed audio lands in the repo. Use your own or a
> royalty-free / CC0 clip; factory-library samples are fine to point at on disk
> but must not be committed. The `--signal` path needs no file, so the whole
> audio pipeline can be validated without adding anything.

The `--report --json` schema is a nested object of numbers keyed by
family/preset: per-band `reactivity`, `animation`, `coverage`, `transient`
(`rise_frames` / `fall_frames` as integers plus their `ratio`), the pairwise
`pixel`/`shape` distinctness matrices, and `near_duplicates`.

## The `core/tests/` harness

Most differential tests render on the **software adapter** (`prefer_software`) so
they hold on any GPU; the exceptions say so below. Run the whole suite:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p lmv-core     # what CI runs (per-test process isolation)
cargo test -p lmv-core            # also fine, except where noted below
```

> **Use `nextest` for the whole suite.** `preset`'s zero-allocation assertion
> counts allocations through a process-global allocator hook, so it is only
> reliable under nextest's per-test process isolation — under stock `cargo test`
> a concurrently-running test's allocations bleed into the count. Tests that need
> a real GPU (`background_composite`, and the in-crate dual-live dissolve check in
> `render/mod.rs`) **skip themselves** when only a software rasterizer is present,
> per [ADR-0016](adrs/0016-gpu-tests-opt-in-ci-scope.md). WARP mis-renders both:
> the fullscreen-scene + background pipeline set, and — once a dissolve allocates
> its blend targets mid-run — what the feedback `trails` stage resolves to.

Individual tests (add `-- --nocapture` to see the printed diagnostics):

| test | kind | asserts |
|------|------|---------|
| `reactivity` | HARD | every preset moves for at least one band (bass/mid/treb/onset); prints the per-band vector so a dead single binding — e.g. treble — is visible |
| `animation` | HARD | every preset changes between frame N and N+k at fixed audio (not frozen) |
| `sanity` | HARD | every preset lights a minimum coverage and spans ≥2 quadrants **against its own background** (not blank, not a dot) |
| `beat` | HARD | a 120 BPM click track through the **real** DSP makes a beat-accent preset render differently on-beat vs off-beat; a zeroed beat binding does not |
| `distinctness` | ADVISORY | prints per-family pixel + shape pairwise matrices and flags near-duplicate geometry; never asserts |
| `golden` | HARD (tolerance) | one **frozen fixture per system** matches its committed baseline PNG within a mean + max-outlier tolerance ([ADR-0023](adrs/0023-golden-drift-guard-uses-frozen-fixtures.md)) |
| `composite` | HARD (tolerance) | the **post stages** — one fixture composes `trails`, one composes `kaleido_*` — match their baselines. Captured at **160x100**, a size whose internal grid is *not* the target's shape, so an aspect error is visible ([ADR-0037](adrs/0037-internal-grid-is-a-resolution-not-a-shape.md)) |
| `reaction_diffusion` | HARD | the first stateful-feedback scene: seed reproducibility, regime response ([ADR-0012](adrs/0012-stateful-feedback-render-system.md)) |
| `attractor` | HARD | the first compute-particle scene: seed reproducibility + beat perturbation ([ADR-0015](adrs/0015-gpu-compute-particle-idiom.md)) |
| `ink` | HARD | the final tone-remap **inverts** tone, and `ink_amount = 0` is byte-identical to an unbound frame ([ADR-0028](adrs/0028-final-stage-ink-tone-remap.md)) |
| `background_composite` | HARD (**hardware only**) | RD / attractor presents alpha-blend over the `bg_*` backdrop; **skipped** on a software adapter, which mis-renders that pipeline set |
| `transition` | HARD | every switch path (cycle **and** select) renders intermediate blended frames as a ramp, reproducibly from the injected `dt`; each blend kind shows its own signature; a switch arriving mid-dissolve lands on the last index requested; a hot-reload mid-dissolve cancels cleanly; the heavy attractor ↔ reaction-diffusion pair dissolves on the freeze fallback (set `LMV_TRANSITION_STRIP=<dir>` to also dump filmstrips) |
| `preset` | HARD | the expression evaluator and TOML schema: exact values, rejection without panic, **zero allocation** per eval, and the `PARAMS` ↔ `set_param` drift guard |
| `dsp` / `ffi` / `hygiene` | HARD | known-signal analysis fixtures; the C ABI across the boundary; the hot-path panic pragma + exact dependency pinning |

**Golden baselines pin frozen fixtures, not shipped presets.** `core/tests/fixtures/*.toml`
is a deliberately minimal preset per `SystemKind`, committed alongside
`core/tests/golden/*.png`; the shipped presets in `presets/` are guarded
*behaviorally* (`sanity` / `reactivity` / `animation`) so the `preset-author` lane can
tune them freely without re-blessing pixels. A new `SystemKind` variant fails
`golden.rs` to **compile** until its fixture exists (exhaustive match, no wildcard arm).

`core::signal` (pure, zero-dep) synthesizes the test audio; `core::render::metrics`
(pure) provides `frame_diff`, `struct_diff`, `coverage`, and `quadrant_spread`,
shared by the tests and the CLI report.

### Golden baselines

Golden baselines live in `core/tests/golden/*.png` and are ordinary PNGs
(viewable in the repo / PR diffs). To regenerate them after an intended visual
change:

```bash
LMV_BLESS=1 cargo test -p lmv-core --test golden
LMV_BLESS=1 cargo test -p lmv-core --test composite   # the two post-stage baselines
```

The `composite_*.png` pair belongs to the `composite` test, not to `golden` —
bless it by naming that binary, which is also what keeps the two scopes from
rewriting each other.

**Eyeball the regenerated PNGs before committing** — the first baseline is easy
to enshrine wrong. The compare tolerates minor cross-GPU rasterization drift; a
genuine change exceeds it.

> **`LMV_BLESS=1` is not scoped to the scene you changed** — it rewrites **every**
> baseline the run touches. `git status` after blessing and `git checkout` the
> baselines your change had no business moving; committing an incidental re-bless
> silently retires the drift guard for that scene. (Learned the hard way in Plan
> 0027, where an over-broad bless moved `fragment_field` and `swarm`.)

## The habit for a new scene

When you add a new scene or preset:

1. **Eyeball it first** — `--preset <name> --out /tmp/new.png` and Read the PNG.
2. **Add the differential cases** — the `reactivity`, `animation`, and `sanity`
   tests iterate the embedded presets automatically, so a new *preset* is covered
   once it's in the default set; a new *system* may need its per-system floor in
   `sanity`. If it's beat-driven, extend `beat`.
3. **Check distinctness** — run `--report` (or the `distinctness` test) to see if
   the new preset is a near-duplicate of an existing one (advisory).
4. **A new *system* needs a golden fixture; a new *preset* does not.** Adding a
   `SystemKind` variant fails `golden.rs` to compile until you author
   `core/tests/fixtures/<system_name>.toml` and add its arm — then bless that one
   baseline after eyeballing it. Shipped presets are never pixel-pinned
   ([ADR-0023](adrs/0023-golden-drift-guard-uses-frozen-fixtures.md)).
